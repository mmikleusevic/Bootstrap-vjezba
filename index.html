            <li>Brandon Richard Flowers, the youngest of six children, was born on June 21, 1981, in Henderson, Nevada, to Jean Yvonne (née Barlow) and Terry Austin Flowers.</li>

            <li> He moved to Las Vegas to live with his aunt and graduated from Chaparral High School in 1999.</li>        
            <li>Flowers responded to an ad that Dave Keuning had placed in the Las Vegas Weekly in late 2001, whereupon they became the Killers.</li>      
            <li>After several short-lived bassists and drummers, Flowers and Keuning were joined by bassist Mark Stoermer and drummer Ronnie Vannucci, and the line-up became official in August 2002.</li>        
            <li> Flowers wrote the lyrics to the single "All These Things That I've Done" and its popular refrain "I Got Soul, But I'm Not A Soldier" that numbered among the "100 Greatest Songs of All Time" by The Daily Telegraph and earned one of the band's seven Grammy nominations.</li>
            <li>Their second album Sam's Town, paid homage to Flowers' hometown and family, and earned the band their first BRIT Awards (Best International Album and Group), and included the chart-topping single "When You Were Young".</li>    
            <li>Before releasing their first Billboard 200 No.1 album Wonderful Wonderful (2017) and chart topping single "The Man," the band took a five-year hiatus during which Flowers released his second and most favorably reviewed solo album to that date.</li>

            <li>The album drew heavy influence from Flowers' hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada, and earned Flowers a Q Award nomination for Best Male Artist (2010). The first single from Flamingo, "Crossfire", was released on June 21. It became Flowers' first top ten single in the UK as a solo artist and was certified silver by the BPI.</li>
            <li>After some of the band members wanted "to take a break from touring and the rat race," Flowers decided to keep it going and record a second solo album.</li>

            <p>"I think I always knew that I would have kids but I didn’t… understand… the… whooooo [brims with tears once again]. That I could love my kids the way that I love ‘em. I didn’t know there was… room for that. You love your wife, your family, but it’s different with your kids. I didn’t know I could be so selfless. I would do anything for my kids. Anything. I guess everybody goes through it."</p>
